## 6.1-1

h is height heap 

min = $f(h) = 2^h$

max = $f(h) = 2^{h+1} - 1$

## 6.1-2

The array has 10 elements and set all elements in the binary tree, the height is 3;
If the array has sixteen elements, the height is 4, so it's $\log_2 (n)$ 

## 6.1-3 

The definition of max-heap is that the root is root >= node

## 6.1-4

The first node on the left to right side of a tree
